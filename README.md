## Goals of the project

UNDERSTAND the fundamental skills to build a responsive website from scratch.

## Technologies used.

HTML / CSS
jQuery
jQuery Plugin "Flickity"
Git

## Personal learning

Building this website from scratch gave me various exercises.
A little while ago, I learned some skills by myself, however, no feedback and everything was done blindly. This project1 exercise has trained me how to organize codes, a deep understanding of box model in html and make use of development services such as GitHub.
